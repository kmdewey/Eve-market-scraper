==================
Step one: run program
Step two:
Step three: profit

just kidding...

put all three files in the python root folder (where it saves files)
open the .py file and run it
when its done running it will tell you how many items were accepted from each variable (profit margin, daily volume, etc.)
use these numbers to fine tune the variables (they are all set to 1 right now, you'll want to chage that)
the .txt file will have a list of all the items in a weird seperation format (both ',' and '|'). 
Use the replace to format however you want
